        <p>I would say 25 aug 2023, jab tera pre-bday celebration kiya tha🥳, that day was so nice yrrr ky btau m, thn 2
            din baad tere ghr p milna.
            Thn I m very very much grateful to u ki tune again n again samne s friendship bdane ka initiative liye🥰. And
            the moment which changed our friendship nd will forever be etched in my heart would be this msg on 23 nov
            2023, whn I was feeling damn low. And just this msg of yours - "Ik tu kuch bhi handle kr sktae, bro u can💎✨", 
            changed me fully😭. Thn ofc that ralamandal trip, ik it
            didn't ended well but still we enjoyed a lot. Then the day when we went to zoo together💝, that was a magical
            day yrrr, that photo of us💕. Thn gol bagiche m sabka Milan coz akele nhi mil skte tab sabke saath enjoy
            krna, uske baad ofc the Diwali timee, whn I came to ur house alone ❤, thn meeting for only 5 mins dmrt k bhr
            coz we wanted to meet even if it's for 5 mins. Thn chupke s itne mahino k baad woh Geeta bhawan p milna, woh
            gaano p vibe krna, to just see each other was just magical at that day. Itni khushiiiiii ayeee hayeeee💓😭
            Thn uske 2-3 din chdke bilawli jaana, uske baad spontaneous madam panipuri or cafe, vhn p woh gaano p dance
            krna, felt like it's just us 💌. And then 9 may ko tere ghr p milna, msti krna. Ofc tere haath k tasty pasta
            khana 😋😋. And uske baad our vcs or calls, uske liye to m ky hi kahi yrrrr, I will forever be grateful to
            have ur friendship💗✨🧿. Mtlb humesha mere saath khade rehna, hr chij share krne k liye meri comfort place bnna,
            that transparent bond ki aon ek dusre ko sb btate, permission lete 😅. Bht acha lgta h yrrr. There have been
            rough patches in our friendship but still we both have been committed to this friendship rather than leading
            to more misunderstandings.💫
            And and and how can I forget ur daat infront of my mother,legit yrrr it's everything very epiccc nd that
            sometimes chal be laudee😂😂
            It's just magical yrrrr, how we are , how our bond is, i genuinely haven't met any better person than you in my life. 
            i m so so proud of you the way u handle things, the way u handle urself, it's just phonomenal. I will always be there 
            for you buddy. Thank u so much for always being there for me😘🧿</p>
